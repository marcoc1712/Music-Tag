*	Medium term

	* Write code to use new capabilities methods on plugins

	* Revise testing, document testing module

	* Improve data value support accross plugins

	* Produce a yaml plugin

*	Long Term

	* Develop album based system, allowing Music::Tag::Amazon, et. al. to
	  see the whole album for comparison.  This will require some new methods
	  and some new thinking.

	* I had developed an Ipod module.  Ipods have change so darn much, and apple
	  has disturbed me enough that I think this is on hold indefinetly, but other
	  ideas might be:

	  * last.fm plugin
	  * rss plugin
	  * twitter plugin (now I'm getting really silly.)
	  * facebook plugin (I've never used facebook, actually.)
